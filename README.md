## Introduction

I am a dedicated hardware engineer with expertise in computer hardware, digital design, embedded systems, etc. My objective is to contribute to cutting-edge hardware solutions that drive technological advancements.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Arduino Weather Humidity Logger](https://github.com/niladrigithub/arduino-weather-humidity-logger)
Description of hardware project 1. This project uses Arduino and a DHT22 sensor to monitor humidity and temperature. The Arduino sketch logs data at intervals, displaying it on the serial monitor. Ideal for weather monitoring, climate studies, or home automation.

### Project 2: [Real-Time Audio Processing System using FPGA and VHDL](https://github.com/niladrigithub/real-time-audio-processing-system)
Description of hardware project 2. The Real-Time Audio Processing System is an FPGA-based project that leverages VHDL to implement a sophisticated audio processing pipeline. The system is designed to process audio input in real-time, applying customizable filters and effects to enhance or modify the audio output.

### Project 3: [8051 Robotic Arm Project](https://github.com/niladrigithub/8051-robotic-arm-project)
Description of hardware project 3. The 8051 Robotic Arm Project is a demonstration of intelligent control using the 8051 microcontroller assembly code. This project showcases a robotic arm system manipulated through precise servo motor control.

### Project 4: [Traffic Light Controller VHDL Project](https://github.com/niladrigithub/traffic-light-controller)
Description of hardware project 4. This VHDL project aims to simulate and control a sophisticated traffic light system, utilizing Xilinx Vivado for FPGA programming. The implementation showcases a robust state machine to manage various traffic scenarios, including pedestrian crossing.

### Project 5: [UART Communication on Xilinx FPGA](https://github.com/niladrigithub/hdl_serial_comm)
Description of hardware project 5. This project presents a robust implementation of UART communication on Xilinx FPGA platforms using VHDL. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) is a widely adopted serial communication protocol that facilitates the exchange of data between devices.

### Project 6: [Digital Alarm Clock VHDL Project](https://github.com/niladrigithub/digital-alarm-clock-vhdl)
Description of hardware project 6. This VHDL project implements a digital alarm clock on an FPGA using Xilinx Vivado. The project includes components for clock generation, timekeeping, display control, and alarm logic. The clock supports user inputs for setting the alarm, and the alarm can be snoozed.

### Project 7: [Hardware Biometric System](https://gitlab.com/niladridas/hardware-biometric-system)
Description of hardware project 7. The Hardware Biometric System (HBS) is a cutting-edge solution designed to provide secure and reliable identification and authentication for individuals and organizations. By integrating biometric features such as fingerprints or facial recognition with advanced security features like encryption and secure communication, the HBS offers a comprehensive solution for user verification and authentication.
